# My_first_Flutter_app_11262023

I created my first Flutter application using Goggle Developers Code Lab in November 2023.  The tutorial was titled “Your first Flutter app” [rev 10/24/23 by Filip Hracek].  My computer platform was a  8X Intel i7 CPU with Debian OS GNU/Linux11.  I attempted to use a copy of Visual Studio Code from Flatpak but this copy did not exhibit the functionality I needed due to restrictions of the version [& my limited knowledge of Flatpak config.].  I re-installed VS Code 1.84.2 from the code visualstudio com website.	Canonical Snapcraft [Snapd] was used to set up Flutter version 3.16.0 SDK.

Section Three of the tutorial set up two yaml files and the core main.dart file.   The two yaml files are simplified in comparison to production versions to facilitate novice first time Flutter users.	My first Flutter app was launched on my web browser in Section Four of the tutorial.  I have included several initial revision screen jpgs.  Section 5 makes the app “prettier”; and is a work-in-progress as of this github posting . 

I have gone from a person with zero coding experience to creating my first Flutter application in ONE DAY.  Many thanks to Goggle Developers Community and Filip Hracek for creating this fun tutorial.
